<p> The matlab code used for extracting the shoreline in our JER-ES paper ([Gao et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1029/2017JF004584)), based on the numerical results of Delft3D simulations. The procedures follow those proposed in [Shaw et al. (2008)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL033963). </p>

A example is given below.
