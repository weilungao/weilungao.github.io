## Bio

I am currently doing my postdoc in [Beijing Normal Unversity at Zhuhai](https://zhuhai.bnu.edu.cn), focusing on the the research topic of ecogeomorphology. I earned my Phd's degree in Beijing Normal Univeristy, Beijing, and my PhD topic is on the combined effects of human-induced variability of river discharges and wave conditions on the morphological evolution of river deltas. I use numerical models to understand and explore the morphological evolution of river deltas at different spatiotemporal scales.
